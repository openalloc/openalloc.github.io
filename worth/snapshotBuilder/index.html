For example, you might want to track your net worth on a monthly basis, so you'll create a new snapshot every month.</p><p>Optionally you can capture cash flow from your brokerage's transaction history. This is useful for those who seek an accurate measure of performance of a portfolio with significant inflows or outflows.</p><h2>Importing your data</h2><p>Imports can be done in two ways: either (1) with the Import menu option or (2) via drag-and-drop.</p><p>The 'Snapshot Builder' section of the sidebar will be highlighted when you've imported data, but not yet created a new snapshot.</p><h3>Brokerage Exports</h3><p>Where supported (with the <em>FINporter</em> open import framework) you can import your brokerage exports directly into <em>FlowWorth</em>.</p><p>Even if you import directly from brokerage statements, you'll probably want to construct your own MAccount and MSecurity delimited files, as described in next section.</p><h3>Account and Security Mappings</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MAccount</td><td>Specify a readable account title and the strategy mapping.</td></tr><tr><td>MSecurity</td><td>Specify an asset mapping for each ticker symbol.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These can be reused as needed, such as with the <em>FlowAllocator</em> app for rebalancing.</p><h2>Imported Data Model Entities</h2><p>For each entity, you can construct your own comma-separated or tab-delimited files for import. If you're importing a supported brokerage file, it usually isn't necessary.</p><p>Import your delimited files via the 'Import' menu or via drag-and-drop.</p><ul><li><a href="../../shared/account/index.html">Account Table</a></li><li><a href="../../shared/account_holding/index.html">Holding Table</a></li><li><a href="../../shared/security/index.html">Security Table</a></li><li><a href="../../shared/transaction/index.html">Transaction Table</a></li><li><a href="../../shared/strategy/index.html">Strategy Table</a></li></ul><p>For more details on these formats, see the <em>OpenAlloc</em> project.</p><h2>Valuation Data Model Entities</h2><p>These are typically generated from your imports and used for long-term storage, along with accounts, assets, and securities.</p><ul><li><a href="../../shared/valuation_cash_flow/index.html">Cashflow Table</a></li><li><a href="../../shared/valuation_position/index.html">Position Table</a></li><li><a href="../../shared/valuation_snapshot/index.html">Snapshot Table</a></li></ul><p>For more details on these formats, see the <em>OpenAlloc</em> project.</p><h2>Interface</h2><h3>Tool Bar</h3><h4>Performance Selector</h4><ul><li>Triangle (Delta) - view changed to reflect change in Market Value</li><li>B - view changed to reflect change in Total Basis</li><li>R - view changed to reflect performance (via Modified Dietz method)</li></ul><h4>Date and Time</h4><p>This is the valuation time stamp, in the time zone you have specified in Configuration Settings.</p><p>If you imported via brokerage exports, this may be set automatically to the timestamp within.</p><p>'now' will set it to the current date and time.</p><p>Note that snapshots must be separated by a minimum of 24 hours, largely due to ambiguities common in transaction history data.</p><h4>Clear</h4><p>This will <strong>delete all records</strong> from the MHolding and MTransaction tables, as is done as part of creating a new snapshot (see below).</p><p>Undo (via Cmd-Z should be supported.)</p><h4>Create Snapshot</h4><p>To create a snapshot, click the 'Create Snapshot' button.</p><p>Creating a new snapshot stores a point-in-time valuation to the data model.</p><p>It will append new records to the following tables in the data model: MValuationSnapshot, MValuationPosition, and MValuationCashflow.</p><p>It will also <strong>delete all records</strong> from the MHolding and MTransaction tables. This allows you to conveniently start fresh to build the next snapshot.</p><p>Undo (via Cmd-Z should be supported.)</p><h3>Period Summary View</h3><p>Access the Summary View via the menu or by clicking the "[B] SNAPSHOT BUILDER" in the side bar. Or by the Control-Command-B shortcut.</p><p>This provides details on the Snapshot's period, before it is committed to <em>FlowWorth</em>'s data model.</p><p>This will be most useful when you've created at least two snapshots.</p><p>For more detail see <a href="../periodSummary/index.html">Period Summary View</a>.</p><h3>Positions View</h3><h4>Imported Holdings</h4><p>These are the records you imported into the MHolding table in the data model. They are the source for creating Position records.</p><p>Note that these will be deleted when you create a new snapshot, or hit the 'clear' button.</p><p>They are sorted by account number, security, and lot (if any).</p><h4>New Positions</h4><p>These are derived from records in the MHolding table in the data model, but rolled-up by asset class.</p><h4>Most Recent Snapshot</h4><p>These are the Position records that were created in the previous snapshot, if there was one. It's provided for convenient comparison.</p><h3>Cash Flow View</h3><p>Capturing Cash Flow from transaction history is optional. This is useful for those who seek an accurate measure of performance of a portfolio with significant inflows or outflows.</p><h4>Imported Transactions</h4><p>These are the records you imported into the MTransaction table in the data model. They are the source for Cash Flow records.</p><p>Note that these will be deleted when you create a new snapshot, or hit the 'clear' button.</p><p>A checkbox is available for you to selectively include (or exclude) transactions to use to build Cash Flow records. Those transactions outside the current snapshot period are unchecked by default.</p><p>Note that because transaction dates in brokerage history data will often not provide precise times, they are considered approximate. You may decide to override the default checkmark setting.</p><h4>New Cash Flow</h4><p>These are derived from records in the MTransaction table in the data model, but rolled-up by asset class.</p><p>If a Cash Flow is undesired, uncheck the corresponding transactions from the "Imported Transactions" table.</p><h4>Most Recent Snapshot</h4><p>These are the Cash Flow records that were created in the previous snapshot, if there was one. It's provided for convenient comparison.</p><h3>Footer</h3><p>The footer contains additional summary data. The 'Performance Selector' in the tool bar can change the content.</p><ul><li>Snapshots - the count of created snapshots, which excludes the snapshot that you're in the process of creating.</li><li>Most Recent Snapshot - the time stamp of the previous snapshot, if any. It also excludes the snapshot that you're in the process of creating.</li><li>Positions (Market Value) - the count of Position records to create and their summed amount</li><li>Cash Flow (Net) - the count of Cash Flow records to create and their net summed amount (which can be negative)</li><li>R (Period) - the performance of data contained in the snapshot, per the Modified Dietz method (requires Cash Flow)</li></ul></div><footer><p>Copyright 2021, OpenAlloc LLC.
