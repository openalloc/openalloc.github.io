The [_OpenAlloc Project_](https://openalloc.github.io/) is a family of applications and re-useable libraries, written in Swift.

## Libraries

A collection of reusable Swift libraries, written principally to support the apps mentioned below, available as Swift Packages.

### Swift Components

* [SwiftCompactor](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftCompactor) - formatters for the concise display of Numbers, Currency, and Time Intervals
* [SwiftModifiedDietz](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftModifiedDietz) - a tool for calculating portfolio performance using the Modified Dietz method
* [SwiftNiceScale](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftNiceScale) - generate 'nice' numbers for label ticks over a range, such as for y-axis on a chart
* [SwiftRegressor](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftRegressor) - a linear regression tool that’s flexible and easy to use
* [SwiftSeriesResampler](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftSeriesResampler) - transform a series of coordinate values into a new series with uniform intervals
* [SwiftSimpleTree](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftSimpleTree) - a nested data structure that’s flexible and easy to use

### User Interface Components, for the SwiftUI Framework

* [SwiftDetailer](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftDetailer) - a multi-platform SwiftUI component for editing fielded data
* [SwiftNumberPad](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftNumberPad) - a multi-platform SwiftUI component for basic number input
* [SwiftTabler](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler) - a multi-platform SwiftUI component for tabular data.
* [SwiftTextFieldPreset](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTextFieldPreset) - a multi-platform SwiftUI component for text input with presets support

## XCode Setup

See the [Workspace](https://github.com/openalloc/Workspace) repository for a handy Xcode workspace that contains most of the re-useable library repositories.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You are encouraged to submit pull requests to fix bugs, improve documentation, or offer new features. 

The pull request need not be a production-ready feature or fix. It can be a draft of proposed changes, or simply a test to show that expected behavior is buggy. Discussion on the pull request can proceed from there.

Contributions should ultimately have adequate test coverage. See tests for current entities to see what coverage is expected.

Your contributions can be under the your name or organization, but must have a compatible license, preferably MPL-2.0 (for app code) or Apache-2.0 (for re-usable library code).

(This should probably be expanded to a proper policy.)
