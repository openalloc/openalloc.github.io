# Welcome to _FlowAllocator_!

## What is _FlowAllocator_?

_FlowAllocator_ is a sophisticated tool for rebalancing one's portfolio.

## Why _FlowAllocator_?

Many of us have multiple investment accounts. They might be taxable or
tax-advantaged. They might serve different investment goals. 

To have multiple investment accounts serve the same goal can be tricky. It
may not make sense to hold certain types of assets in an account. For
example, it may not be tax efficient to hold a gold ETF in a taxable
account. 

Certain accounts are restricted in the assets they can hold. A cash
management account holds only cash, for example. Your 401K may not offer
a Foreign Small Cap fund, or if it does, the fee may be prohibitively
high.

We can individually tailor each account to a different investment goal, or
roughly mirror each with a basic allocation. But to have them work in
concert towards a common strategy allocation can be a complex undertaking,
especially if that allocation changes over time.

FlowAllocator steps in to provide a convenient solution to this dilemma,
tolerating the demands of different accounts while directing them all
towards the same goal.

It works with exports from your investment accounts* as well as with delimited files in standardized and open formats.

It gives you an overview of your holdings.

It lets you experiment with your strategy.

It can assist you in finding optimal allocation to meet your investment
goals.
