# Orphaned Holdings Table

This pertains to ‘non-trading’ accounts only.

Some (or possibly all) holdings in ‘non-trading’ accounts may not be
relevant to the current Strategy’s allocation. These are the orphans.

Some holdings will be excluded in their entirety, such as $5K in
‘International Bonds’ when your allocation omits them.

Other holdings will be partially excluded. For example, if the non-traded
‘Cash’ money market account has more than what’s needed in the allocation,
the surplus is orphaned.

## Advanced Features

Both the ‘Roll-up Assets’ and ‘Group Related Holdings’ features can reduce
orphans, bringing the holdings into the Strategy’s allocation, by
leveraging relationships between asset classes.
