#  Getting Started

First steps to tracking your portfolio with _FlowWorth_:

1. Create (or import) your accounts

2. Import holdings for those accounts (e.g. from brokerage positions export)

3. Ensure each held security is priced and assigned to an asset class

4. Create the initial valuation snapshot using the Snapshot Builder

At least one day later...

5. Import _updated_ holdings for your accounts

6. (Optionally) import transactions (e.g. from brokerage transaction export)

7. Create the second valuation snapshot using the Snapshot Builder

8. Review how things changed!
