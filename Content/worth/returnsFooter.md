## Summary Info

Use the Period Summary Selection in the menu or tool bar to see different sets of data described below.

The summary info may be reduced depending on available screen real estate.

## Period Summary Selection

This drives the columns shown. Available in the toolbar, menu, and as keyboard shortcuts.

### Change in Market Value (Δ), or Change in Total Basis (B)

* Period - duration of currently-selected period
* Δ% (period) - the change in market value, as a percent ($Δ / start)
* Δ% (CAGR) - compound annual growth rate, as a percent ((end/start) ^ (1/years))
* Δ (daily) - an averaged daily projection of the change in value
* Market Value - the minimum and maximum valuations over the snapshots of the period

Note that Δ% will show "n/a" if the period started with a non-positive value.

### Performance (R)

* Period - duration of currently-selected period
* R (period) - the performance for the period, independent of cash flow
* R (annualized) - an annualized projection of the above
* Net Cash Flow - the absolute sum of all flows for the period
* Market Value - the minimum and maximum valuations over the snapshots of the period

## Period Range 

Use the Period Range toggle button (or the menu or keyboard shortcut) to reveal (or hide) the period range controls.

You can use these to restrict the period by the available Snapshots.
