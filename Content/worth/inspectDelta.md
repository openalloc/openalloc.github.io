# Returns Inspector Delta (Δ)

The market value of your assets over time, _net_ of cash flows.

## Performance (Whole Period)

Only the starting and the ending Snapshot are considered. Those in between are ignored.

“%Δ (CAGR)” is the Compound Annual Growth Rate based on the change in value over the period. See [CAGR at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate) for more details.

## Snapshot Performance Table

The change in market value for individual Snapshots is shown, as well as the period to date.

Note that the %Δ column (showing performance to date) will show "n/a" if the period started with a non-positive value.
