# Terms and Conditions

The current version of this document can be found at [https://openalloc.github.io/flow/terms/](https://openalloc.github.io/flow/terms/).

The _FlowAllocator_ and _FlowWorth_ apps have been released under the Mozilla Public License 2.0, available at [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

By downloading and using either the _FlowAllocator_ and _FlowWorth_ app, the terms of the license will automatically apply to you. Review fully and carefully before using the software. Two important sections are excerpted below.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

Both _FlowAllocator_ and _FlowWorth_ are for educational purposes only. They do not provide investment or tax advice. Their developers (OpenAlloc LLC and project contributors) are not advisers and do not offer investment or tax advice. Before making any investment decisions from use of the apps, you should carefully inspect the output to ensure their calculations are fully consistent with your investment objectives.

Any products, services, or strategies (e.g., stock tickers, brokerages, asset allocations, etc.) mentioned in the software, documentation, or website are examples provided for educational purposes only. They are neither endorsements nor recommendations. It is your responsibility to do the research (or consult a professional) to find suitable vehicles for your investment needs.

These ‘terms and conditions’ are subject to change and will be included in future releases of the software.

NOTE: failure to acknowledge these terms may result in restricted functionality of the app.
