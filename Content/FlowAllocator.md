# Welcome to FlowAllocator

_FlowAllocator_ is a portfolio rebalancing tool for do-it-yourself investors.

Whether your strategy is passive or active, or whether you rebalance annually or more frequently, _FlowAllocator_ can provide flexibility in managing those rebalances, and help you save time, gain insight, and discover new opportunities.

_FlowAllocator_ offers features accessible to those new to investing, as well as sophisticated capabilities for those who are managing multiple investment strategies across multiple accounts.

Your privacy is paramount. Financial data in _FlowAllocator_ stays local to your computer. None of it is uploaded to the cloud. No connection to remote providers is involved. 

[Available for download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flowallocator/id1572300664) in the Mac App Store. (U.S. only for now)
