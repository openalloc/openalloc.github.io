# Privacy Policy

The current version of this document can be found at [https://openalloc.github.io/privacy/](https://openalloc.github.io/privacy/).

At OpenAlloc LLC, we respect your privacy. We believe that the less we know about you and your personal financial data, the better; that is why we aim to limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary. 

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted to OpenAlloc LLC’s website and our apps for macOS and any other devices and platforms.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the terms “OpenAlloc LLC”, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the company OpenAlloc LLC; the terms “application“, “app”, “service”, and “product” refer to the FlowAllocator and FlowWorth software, website, and any related services; and “you” refers to you, as a user of the application as applicable.

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time (and without prior notification), which we will do through online posting. 

## Information we collect

Your financial data is stored exclusively in zip-compressed “.allocatz” (for FlowAllocator) and “.worthz” (for FlowWorth) files you save locally to your device’s file system. The application does not upload this data. Nor does the application offer online storage, backup, or syncing with third-party services, including Apple’s iCloud service.

We may collect a limited amount of information that is necessary to improve the app, and to provide support. To help identify and solve specific problems with our products and services, we occasionally solicit diagnostic reports and other troubleshooting, bug, and crash reports from customers. 

The website may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs. If you decide to contact us via email, we receive an email with the details you provided (your email address, the name and the text). 

## Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our apps, website, and customer support. For instance, we will respond to an email to answer your question or help you fix a problem, but we do not use your email address for marketing purposes or share it with others.

We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.

In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Security

We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. 

## Accessing, changing, or deleting information

You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you, such as that found in support emails. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.

## Information for European Union Customers

By using the application and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent

By using our website or software, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may contact us via the support email.

## Changes to this policy

We will post changes to our Privacy Policy on this page. Summary of changes so far:

* June 28, 2021: First published.
* October 27, 2021: Added support for FlowWorth application.
* January 5, 2022: Simplification to remove "To improve the software, we may collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features." as there are no plans to collect usage information.
* August 18, 2022: Updated for OpenAlloc LLC and lack of subscriptions.
