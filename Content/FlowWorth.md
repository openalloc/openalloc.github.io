## Import Support

Through the _FINporter_ project in _OpenAlloc_, _FlowWorth_ supports\* the direct import of export files from some brokerages (and services). These presently include:

<div class="special_table"></div>

| Service | Type | Notes |
| ------- | ---- | ------- |
| [Fidelity Investments](https://fidelity.com) | Brokerage | |
| [Schwab Brokerage Services](https://schwab.com) | Brokerage | New in October 2021 |
| [Allocate Smartly](https://allocatesmartly.com) | Tactical Allocation Provider | |

<br/>

See the _FINporter_ [README](https://github.com/openalloc/FINporter) for more details.

Where direct import of brokerage statements isn't available, you can import data using delimited (CSV, etc.) tables using the formats specified in _AllocData_. See its [README](https://github.com/openalloc/AllocData) for more details.

\*_Support of any service, including those mentioned above, is neither a recommendation nor endorsement. Do your own research to find suitable vehicles to meet your investment objectives, or seek professional guidance._
