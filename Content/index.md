*** IMPORTANT NOTE as of August 2022, both FlowAllocator and FlowWorth are open source. All ‘Investor’ features that were formerly an in-app purchase are now available to all users. ***

# Welcome to the OpenAlloc Project

The _OpenAlloc Project_ focuses on tools useful to the do-it-yourself investor.

It consists both of applications and re-usable libraries, with a emphasis on investing.

_FlowAllocator_ is an application for rebalancing one’s portfolio.

_FlowWorth_ is an application for tracking the value of one’s portfolio over time.

These applications, currently available on macOS, offer features accessible to those new to investing, as well as sophisticated capabilities for those who are managing multiple investment strategies across multiple accounts.

They provide you flexibility in managing your investment portfolio and can help you save time, gain insight, and discover new opportunities.

Your privacy is paramount. Financial data in _FlowAllocator_ and _FlowWorth_ stays local to your computer. None of it is uploaded to the cloud. No connection to remote providers is involved.

_OpenAlloc_ is the open source framework upon which _FlowAllocator_ and _FlowWorth_ are built. It includes the _AllocData_ data model and _FINporter_ import framework projects.

_AllocData_ is the data model describing the format for import files, export files, as well as the storage of your investing data in _allocatz_ and _worthz_ document files. ([source at github](https://github.com/openalloc/AllocData))

_FINporter_ is the open import framework, providing support for transforming position and transaction data from brokerage export files. Currently two brokerages are supported. ([source at github](https://github.com/openalloc/FINporter))
