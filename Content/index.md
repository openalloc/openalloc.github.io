_OpenAlloc_ is the open source framework upon which _FlowAllocator_ and _FlowWorth_ are built. It includes the _AllocData_ data model and _FINporter_ import framework projects.

_AllocData_ is the data model describing the format for import files, export files, as well as the storage of your investing data in _allocatz_ and _worthz_ document files. ([source at github](https://github.com/openalloc/AllocData))

_FINporter_ is the open import framework, providing support for transforming position and transaction data from brokerage export files. Currently two brokerages are supported. ([source at github](https://github.com/openalloc/FINporter))
