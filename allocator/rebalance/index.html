Then purchases, also in the same order.</p><p>See the account’s “Rebalance Summary” to see how these numbers are arrived at.</p><h2>The Rebalance Bubble</h2><p>Each ‘bubble’ displays the current status of the asset class, plus the actions required to rebalance.</p><h3>Sales</h3><p>The footer is the name of the asset class. The upper right contains the total amount of securities to be liquidated from the asset class.</p><p>One or more ‘trash cans’ will be listed showing individual positions to liquidate. An approximate share count may be listed, based on the share price in the Securities table.</p><p>The ‘+/-’ shows the approximate gain (or loss) from the trade(s).</p><p>The ‘W’ indicates potential wash sales. Making the trade may sacrifice some (or all) of the tax deduction. (Consult the relevant literature for all the details.)</p><h3>Purchases</h3><p>The footer is the name of the asset class. The upper right contains the total amount of securities to be purchased for the asset class.</p><p>A ‘shipping box’ may be present listing your current holdings in the asset class, including the tickers.</p><p>A ‘shopping cart’ will list the amount to be purchased.</p><p>The ‘W’, if present, indicates potential wash purchases, meaning that there was a recent sale at a loss in a taxable account. Preserving this tax loss can benefit your portfolio performance. (Consult the literature to learn how to do this.)</p><h2>Export</h2><p>The rebalance export will be a zip file containing delimited tables:</p><ul><li><code>purchases.csv</code> - purchases required by the rebalance</li><li><code>sales.csv</code> - sales required by the rebalance</li><li><code>trading-allocations.csv</code> - allocated amounts for trading accounts</li><li><code>non-trading-allocations.csv</code> - allocated amounts for non-trading accounts</li></ul><p>...adhering to the schemas:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/openalloc/AllocData#mrebalancepurchase">openalloc/rebalance/purchase</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/openalloc/AllocData#mrebalancesale">openalloc/rebalance/sale</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/openalloc/AllocData#mrebalanceallocation">openalloc/rebalance/allocation</a></li></ul><p>Also included is a <code>params.json</code> file that contains the participating accounts and asset classes, and the flow value.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>Available in the Rebalance View from the Strategy View.</p><h3>Minimum Sale Amount</h3><p>If the liquidation(s) for an asset class in an account is less than this value, it will not be listed in the rebalance.</p><h3>Minimum Position Size</h3><p>To avoid leaving behind tiny positions, set this value as needed.</p><p>A liquidation may be larger than needed to ‘clean up’ any residual positions. In the SELL bubble, look for the ‘ALL’ in place of an approximate number of shares.</p><h2>Advanced Features</h2><p>The advanced features will have a big impact on rebalancing. For example, <em>Roll-up Assets</em> and <em>Group Related Holdings</em> can help retain holdings that might otherwise need to be liquidating in a rebalance.</p><p>More specifically...</p><h3>Optimization</h3><p>By sorting on ‘Transactions’ and ‘Sale Volume’ the amount of trading needed to rebalance can be minimized.</p><p>When provided with recent transaction history, optimization can also sort on ‘Wash Sale’ to minimize wash sales that result from liquidating positions in taxable accounts where there has recently been a related purchase.</p><h3>Reduce Rebalance</h3><p>Consolidation’s “Reduce Rebalance” feature matches liquidations with purchases of related asset classes in an account’s rebalance. Where present, one can offset the other.</p><p>For example, if the rebalance calls for liquidating $10K of VB (Small Cap) and purchasing $8K of VTI (Total Market), these are close enough to reduce to a $2K liquidation of VB.</p><p>This offsetting of related trades can also reduce potential wash sales.</p></div><footer><p>Copyright 2021-2022, OpenAlloc LLC.
