We believe that the less we know about you and your personal financial data, the better; that is why we aim to limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary.</p><p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted to OpenAlloc LLC’s website and our apps for macOS and any other devices and platforms.</p><p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the terms “OpenAlloc LLC”, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the company OpenAlloc LLC; the terms “application“, “app”, “service”, and “product” refer to the FlowAllocator and FlowWorth software, website, and any related services; and “you” refers to you, as a user of the application as applicable.</p><p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time (and without prior notification), which we will do through online posting.</p><h2>Information we collect</h2><p>Your portfolio data is stored exclusively in zip-compressed “.allocatz” (for FlowAllocator) and “.worthz” (for FlowWorth) files you save locally to your device’s file system. The application does not upload this data. Nor does the application offer online storage, backup, or syncing with third-party services, including Apple’s iCloud service.</p><p>We collect a limited amount of information that is necessary to manage subscriptions, to improve the app, and to provide support.</p><p>To manage and verify your subscription across multiple devices, we collect your digital purchase receipts from Apple together with a unique device identifier. The digital purchase receipts only include information about the type and the time of a purchase. We do not see any contact or payment information. We also do not have access to your Apple ID. In addition to the basic purchase information, we may collect data about redeemed trial and promotional codes.</p><p>To help identify and solve specific problems with our products and services, we occasionally solicit diagnostic reports and other troubleshooting, bug, and crash reports from customers.</p><p>The website may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs. If you decide to contact us through the contact form, we receive an email with the details you provided (your email address, the name and the text).</p><h2>Information usage</h2><p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our apps, website, and customer support. For instance, we will respond to the provided email address in the contact form to answer your question or help you fix a problem, but we do not use your email address for marketing purposes or share it with others.</p><p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p><p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p><h2>Security</h2><p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.</p><h2>Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h2><p>You can access and manage your application subscription through your Apple ID account.</p><p>Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.</p><p>You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you, such as that found in support emails. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p><h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2><p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p><h2>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2><p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p><h2>Information for European Union Customers</h2><p>By using the application and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.</p><h2>International Transfers of Information</h2><p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.</p><h2>Your Consent</h2><p>By using our website or software, you consent to our privacy policy.</p><h2>Contacting Us</h2><p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email support@flowallocator.app.</p><h2>Changes to this policy</h2><p>We will post changes to our Privacy Policy on this page.
