Review fully and carefully before using the software. Two important sections are excerpted below.</p><hr><ol start="6"><li>Disclaimer of Warranty</li></ol><p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</p><ol start="7"><li>Limitation of Liability</li></ol><p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p><hr><p>Both <em>FlowAllocator</em> and <em>FlowWorth</em> are for educational purposes only.

It is your responsibility to do the research (or consult a professional) to find suitable vehicles for your investment needs.</p><p>These ‘terms and conditions’ are subject to change and will be included in future releases of the software.</p><p>NOTE: failure to acknowledge these terms may result in restricted functionality of the app.</p></div><footer><p>Copyright 2021-2022, OpenAlloc LLC.
